## <a name="what"></a>What? (Features)

***Convert your downloaded bank statements into YNAB's input format.*** Here's what this script does, step by step:

1. Look for and parse the `bank2ynab.conf`. This file contains all the rules and import formats.
1. Look for and parse every CSV file in the configured download directory.
1. If the CSV file matches any of the configured formats:
   1. Create a new CSV file in YNAB's CSV format with the correct columns and a blank Category column.
   1. Optionally delete the original CSV file.

### <a name="wishlist"></a>Wish List

- add many more input formats from all the [other YNAB-CSV-conversion projects](https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=ynab+convert&s=updated&type=Repositories&utf8=%E2%9C%93).
- maybe coming later: automatically download your bank statements? (uses external services; only available in some countries)
- maybe coming later: automatically import the converted data into your YNAB app? (optional, default off)

## <a name="why"></a>Why?

There are currently more than 80 GitHub projects related to YNAB converter scripts. Clearly there's a need, but until now these solutions have been fragmented. The present project "bank2ynab" aims to focus the efforts on a common source that encapsulates a large number of bank formats. This will also provide a common basis for a solution using a variety of programming languages.

## <a name="how"></a>How? Contribute!

- If you're "just a user":
  - [tell us your import format](https://goo.gl/forms/b7SNwTxmQFfnXlMf2) and we can create a converter - for you and for everyone else!
  - use the converter provided here and [give us feedback](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/issues/new/choose) - or participate!
- If you've already built a YNAB converter:
  - take advantage of this project to get more import formats.
  - give back to this project by [sharing your existing import formats](https://goo.gl/forms/b7SNwTxmQFfnXlMf2).
- Add a brainstorming item as a [new issue](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/issues/new).
- Join the chat over at https://gitter.im/bank2ynab/Lobby
- See also: [the wiki](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/wiki), perhaps most importantly [this page about import formats](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/wiki/ImportFormats).

## <a name=install></a>Installation Instructions

- Download [this ZIP file](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/archive/master.zip)
- Note the [Requirements](#requirements) for additional details!
- When you're done, refer to the [User Guide](#userguide) below.

### <a name="requirements"></a>Requirements

- Windows or Mac or Linux
- Python v3.5+ installed ([download it from python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)) (Python v2.7 *might* work but we make no promises; Py2 has end-of-life on 01Jan2020.)
- Support for other scripting languages may follow. Contributions are welcome!

## <a name="userguide"></a>User Guide

Using `bank2ynab` is easy:

1. Download some bank statements from your banking website.
   - Make sure to choose CSV format. Save with the default suggested filename so that the converter can find it.
   - It's okay if the statements contain data that you already have in YNAB. YNAB will detect and skip these.
1. Check the `[DEFAULT]` configuration in `user_configuration.conf`. *You only need to do this once.* Specifically:
   - `Source Path = c:\users\example-username\Downloads` Specify where you save your downloaded CSV files.
   - `Delete Source File = True` set to `False` if you want to keep the original CSV you downloaded.
1. Check that the configuration in `bank2ynab.conf` contains a `[SECTION]` for your banking format. *You only need to do this once per bank you use.* If you can't find your bank in the config, [tell us your bank's format](https://goo.gl/forms/b7SNwTxmQFfnXlMf2) and we can add it to the project.
1. Install the required dependencies by navigating to the `bank2ynab` directory in your command line and entering the following - `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.
1. Run the `bank2ynab.py` conversion script to generate the YNAB-ready CSV output file. How to do this depends on your operating system:
   - Windows: Open a command prompt, navigate to the script directory, and run the command `python bank2ynab.py`.
     - Pro tip: Create a program shortcut! Right-click on the `bank2ynab.bat` file, choose *Send to* and then choose *Desktop (create shortcut)*. Now you can just double-click that shortcut!
   - Linux/Mac: Open a terminal, navigate to the script directory, and run the command `python3 ./bank2ynab.py`.
     - *Important:* Be sure to use `python3` specifically, and not `python` or `python2` which is probably the system default.
 1. Depending on your configuration, the conversion script will now import your files into YNAB automatically, or you can add the files manually:
    - **Automatic import** (when you have provided [your YNAB API access token](https://github.com/bank2ynab/bank2ynab/wiki/Create-your-YNAB-API-access-token): 
      - The conversion script will now ask you which budget it should use to import your converted CSV file to (if you have multiple). It will also ask you which account inside the budget to use (if you have multiple); you'll only have to answer this question once.
    - **Manually drag-and-drop** the converted CSV file onto the YNAB web app:
      - YNAB will detect this and offer you import options. If you had already switched YNAB to the corresponding account view, YNAB will understand that you want to import this file to this account.
