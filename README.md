# bank2ynab
A common project to consolidate all conversion efforts from various banks' export formats into YNAB's import format.

## Why?

There are currently more than 80 GitHub projects related to YNAB converter scripts. Clearly there's a need, but until now these solutions have been fragmented. The present project "bank2ynab" aims to focus the efforts on a common source that encapsulates a large number of bank formats. This will also provide a common basis for a solution using a variety of programming languages.

## How? Contribute!

- If you're "just a user":
  - tell us your import format and we can create a converter - for you and for everyone else!
  - use the converter provided here and give us feedback - or participate!
- If you've already built a YNAB converter:
  - take advantage of this project to get more import formats.
  - give back to this project by sharing your existing import formats.
- add a brainstorming item as a new issue in the [issue list](https://github.com/torbengb/bank2ynab/issues)
- read or add to the [wiki](https://github.com/torbengb/bank2ynab/wiki) and most importantly the [list of bank formats](https://github.com/torbengb/bank2ynab/wiki/ImportFormats).

## Features

- convert your downloaded bank statements into YNAB's input format
- maybe coming: automatically download your bank statements?

## Requirements

- Windows or Mac or Linux
- Support for Python, or Ruby, or some other scripting language (to be defined)
